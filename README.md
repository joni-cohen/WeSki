# Things that can be improved
UI is not fully fix, would have improve it\
I would have improve the UI components and more separation\
Seoarate the form using react form or similar\
Separate the style from components\
Maybe would add react query for cache and performance \
Also would have fully typed the code \
Add error boundary component in client in case of error from api\
And some clean for dependencies
